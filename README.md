# Asteroid Attack!

Asteroid Attack! is a simple retro-inspired space shooter game where you defend your spaceship from incoming asteroids.

The game aesthetics were loosely inspired by some of the early video games which simple, vector-based graphics and a limited colour palette.

## Notes

I created this project for my Sask Polytech MULT 217 students as an example of a simple game that can be created with p5.js.

It was a quick build so it contains some sloppy or inefficient code. And it could also use a few additional gameplay elements to make it more fun. But it works well enough for the intended purpose of a demo.
