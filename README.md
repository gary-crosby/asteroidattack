# Asteroid Attack!

Asteroid Attack! is a simple retro-inspired space shooter game where you defend your spaceship from incoming asteroids. The game aesthetics were loosely inspired by early vector-based green monochrome video games.

I created it for my Sask Polytech MULT 217 students as a simple game demo created with p5.js.

## Notes

It was a quick build so the game contains some sloppy/inefficient code and it could use additional gameplay elements but it works.

**You must run the game from a live server**.
