# Asteroid Attack!

Asteroid Attack! is a simple retro-inspired space shooter game where you defend your spaceship from incoming asteroids.

I created it as a simple p5.js gaming demo for my MULT 217 students.

You must run the game from a live server.

## Notes

The game aesthetics were inspired by early vector-based green monochrome video games.

The game isn't perfect, it contains some sloppy/inefficient code, and it could use a few gameplay embellishments but it works.
