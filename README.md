# Asteroid Attack!

Asteroid Attack! is a simple retro-inspired space shooter game where you defend your spaceship from incoming asteroids. The game aesthetics were loosely inspired by early vector-based green monochrome video games.

## Notes

I created this project for my Sask Polytech MULT 217 students as a demo of a simple game you can create with p5.js.

It was a quick build so it contains some sloppy/inefficient code and it could use additional gameplay elements to make it more fun. But it works as a demo.

**You must run the game from a server**.
